## Getting Started
- Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), set your board to the Uno R3
- You may also need to download the Rosetta library if running Apple silicon chipset [Support Docs](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/7765785712156-Error-bad-CPU-type-in-executable-on-macOS).
- Install the FastLED library
- Copy/paste what code you want, compile, and send to the Uno
- Enjoy!
